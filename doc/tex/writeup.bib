ABSTRACT={The ‘Diet Problem’ (the search of a low-cost diet that would meet the nutritional needs of a US Army soldier) is characterised by a long history, whereas most solutions for comparable diet problems were developed in 2000 or later, during which computers with large calculation capacities became widely available and linear programming (LP) tools were developed. Based on the selected literature (52 papers), LP can be applied to a variety of diet problems, from food aid, national food programmes and dietary guidelines to individual issues. This review describes the developments in the search for constraints. After nutritional constraints, costs constraints, acceptability constraints and ecological constraints were introduced. The 12 studies that apply ecological constraints were analysed and compared in detail. Most studies have used nutritional constraints and cost constraints in the analysis of dietary problems and solutions, but such research begin showing weaknesses under situations featuring a small number of food items and/or nutritional constraints. Introducing acceptability constraints is recommended, but no study has provided the ultimate solution to calculating acceptability. Future possibilities lie in finding LP solutions for diets by combining nutritional, costs, ecological and acceptability constraints. LP is an important tool for environmental optimisation and shows considerable potential as an instrument for finding solutions to a variety of very complex diet problems.}

abstract = "The main purpose of the paper is to introduce a mixed-integer programming model for the diet problem with glycemic load (GL) values of foods as objective function parameters. It is assumed that the glycemic load values are subject to uncertainty. The diet problem with minimum cost function is well-known in the literature. However, the diet problem with minimum total daily GL values of foods that satisfies the daily nutritional and serving size requirements has not been proposed. Robust optimization approach is used to account for uncertainty in the GL values of foods. The decision maker is flexible to tune the degree of uncertainty rather than assuming a worst-case scenario. An experimental analysis with a total of 177 foods is performed based on the nutritional and serving size requirements and the basic food groups recommended by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services & U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The results of the experimental analysis with different scenarios give different solutions for different degrees of uncertainty. However, some foods are frequently found to be in the optimum solutions. These foods are in good agreement with the literature advising them as a part of a daily diet for attaining low level of blood glucose levels. Although we believe that the proposed diet problem with minimum total GL has contributions for satisfying the daily nutritional and serving size requirements with a minimum level of effect on blood glucose levels, it has several limitations. It is a basic diet problem, and assumes that the overall GL is a linear combination of number of serving sizes with the GL values of foods. It also does not consider any other factors such as several combinations of foods and their varying effects on blood glucose levels. These factors should be considered for the next research."

abstract = "The question of how to minimize monetary cost while meeting basic nutrient requirements (a subsistence diet) was posed by George Stigler in 1945. The problem, known as Stigler's diet problem, was famously solved using the simplex algorithm. Today, we are not only concerned with the monetary cost of food, but also the environmental cost. Efforts to quantify environmental impacts led to the development of footprint (FP) indicators. The environmental footprints of food production span multiple dimensions, including greenhouse gas emissions (carbon footprint), nitrogen release (nitrogen footprint), water use (blue and green water footprint) and land use (land footprint), and a diet minimizing one of these impacts could result in higher impacts in another dimension. In this study based on nutritional and population data for the United States, we identify diets that minimize each of these four footprints subject to nutrient constraints. We then calculate tradeoffs by taking the composition of each footprint's minimum diet and calculating the other three footprints. We find that diets for the minimized footprints tend to be similar for the four footprints, suggesting there are generally synergies, rather than tradeoffs, among low footprint diets. Plant-based food and seafood (fish and other aquatic foods) commonly appear in minimized diets and tend to most efficiently supply macronutrients and micronutrients, respectively. Livestock products rarely appear in minimized diets, suggesting these foods tend to be less efficient from an environmental perspective, even when nutrient content is considered. The results' emphasis on seafood is complicated by the environmental impacts of aquaculture versus capture fisheries, increasing in aquaculture, and shifting compositions of aquaculture feeds. While this analysis does not make specific diet recommendations, our approach demonstrates potential environmental synergies of plant- and seafood-based diets. As a result, this study provides a useful tool for decision-makers in linking human nutrition and environmental impacts."
